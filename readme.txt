PyWars

Prereqs:
 - Python 2.7
 - Pygame 1.9.1

***Pygame installation:***
http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

You can find the appropriate installation file for your OS and Python version at the above link. Easy! :)

***Running Pywars***
If you're on Windows I've provided a run.bat file to save you the effort of actually having to open up any of the source files, but otherwise, just open and run mainMenu.py :)
